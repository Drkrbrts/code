what is the difference between props and state 

in the counter Component we are using props to initialize state. 

props includes data that we give to a Component. 

state includes data that is private or local to that Component.
so other Components cannot access that state. In other words if we go to our 
counters Component all the the attributes that we are setting in 

so you want to handle the event on the parent class that owns the state for example Counter is 
controlling how many counters we have through it's state. there for we should define the delete counter handler 
inisde the counter class. We can do this by passing a function as a prop to the child class in this case that 
Function is the event handler.


child componenets will be controlled meaning the parent will handle the event data.
