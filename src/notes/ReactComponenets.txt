So you are unable to pass arguments to functions inside of onClick therefore, 
whenever you want to passs arguments you would have to do it like this:

say you want an even in regards to some products ID then you would do this 


incrementCount = (product) => {
    // console.log("button is firing: ", this.state.count);
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  };


  <button
          className="btn btn-secondary btn-sm"
          type="submit"
          onClick={()=> this.incrementCount(product.id)} //an anonymous call back function.
        >
          Increment
        </button>


lets use filter to delete items.
ex: 

handleDelete = Movie => {
    const movies = this.state.movies.filter(m => m._id !== movie._id);
    this.setState({movies});
};
