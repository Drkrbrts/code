                        As a software developer, Gregario kept coming across candidates who were strong in theory and could talk code but a
                        vast majority of them had to be retrained to perform applicable coding tasks outlined in their job descriptions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While working in the tech space, Gregario as a developer and Liliana for a real estate online platform,
                        they both noticed that coding was not accessible to everyone and they wanted to tear down as many barriers
                        as possible to increase accessibility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2013, they founded Sabio while both running full-time day jobs. They were so passionate about their
                        mission that the 4 students they started with didn’t pay them until they all got jobs post-graduation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To continue the mission of developing competent software engineers who won’t require retraining when they
                        join the workforce, Sabio coding bootcamp employs top tech developers who bring a wealth of experience to the class.
